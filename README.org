* Rogue

Personal [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] layer. Color settings are lying in a messy state in
~./config.el~, which are defined as overrides over themes ~spacemacs-light~ (light
theme) and ~doom-molokai~ (dark theme). All other configuration is split across
/packages/ (see directory ~./local/~) named ~rogue-*~ and corresponding init fuctions
in ~./packages.el~.

- rogue-ligatures :: Ligatures using /Fira Code Symbol/ font.
- rogue-mu4e :: Email setup using mu4e.
- rogue-org :: Org mode and other writing related config.
- rogue-processes :: Process management stuff.
- rogue-ui :: Non color (and non org) ui settings.
- rogue-utils :: Common functions used across other ~rogue-*~ packages.

It looks something like the screens below (might not be updated).
