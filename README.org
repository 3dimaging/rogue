Personal [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] layer. Color settings are lying in a messy state in
~./config.el~, which are defined as overrides over themes ~spacemacs-light~ (light
theme) and ~doom-molokai~ (dark theme). All other configuration is split across
/packages/ (see directory ~./local/~) named ~r-*~ and corresponding init fuctions in
~./packages.el~. A few are listed below:

- r-ligatures :: Ligatures using /Fira Code Symbol/ font.
- r-mu4e :: Email setup using mu4e.
- r-org :: Org mode and other writing related config.
- r-processes :: Process management stuff.
- r-ui :: Non color (and non org) ui settings.
- r-utils :: Common functions used across other ~r-*~ packages.

It looks something like the screens below (might not be updated).
